To run this program correctly, you will need to set several option parameters:

The options for the program are:
-n <number>                this sets the number of worker processes to launch.
-s <number>                this sets how many workers can run at once.
-t <number>                this sets the maximum time in seconds a worker could run for.
-f <output_file_name.txt>  this sets the name of the file to output to.

Example: ./oss -n 3 -s 2 -t 5 -f "output.txt"
